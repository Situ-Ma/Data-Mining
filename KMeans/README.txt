Environment required:
Python 3 -- Anaconda 4.3.0 (64-bit)

*PLEASE NOTE
	- Your code must run in Python 3 -- Anaconda 4.3.0 (64-bit) out of the box
	- The folder/file structure for the code files does not matter. Place the files in any directory you'd like, but you must keep the exact names.

For each dataset, it contains 3 columns, with the format: x1 \t x2 \t cluster_label. You need to use the first two columns for clustering, and the last column for evaluation.


Information about code files:

*DataPoints.py
	Helper class/functions.
	
*KMeans.py
	1. The file prints results from the algorithm run on all three datasets.
	2. Points with cluster labels are stored in KMeans.csv (currently stores the result of dataset 3; change the last dataset run for other dataset results).
